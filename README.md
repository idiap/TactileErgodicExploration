A Python package for ergodic control on point cloud using diffusion. It is supplementary material for the paper "Tactile Ergodic Control Using Diffusion and Geometric Algebra." The package uses Laplacian eigenbasis for computing the potential field resulting from the diffusion on the point cloud. Then, it uses the heat-equation-driven area coverage (HEDAC) method to guide the exploration agents for tactile ergodic control tasks. This research is conducted at the Robot Learning and Interaction group of the Idiap Research Institute.

It is possible to generate all the simulation data and the plots used in the paper using this repository.

Notebooks:
- tactile_ergodic_control.ipynb
    - A notebook describing the whole method from start to finish with references and equations. All the simulation data used in the paper are generated using the "multi" option for the simulation_type and running the notebook once for each shape.

Scripts:
- pointcloud_utils.py
    - A collection of utility functions for pointcloud operations
- plotting_utils.py
    - A collection of utility functions for plotting
- virtual_agents.py
    - Classes for the first and second order virtual agents.

Point clouds:
- Stanford Bunny from the original dataset bun270.ply, 'X' image projected to it using set_point_cloud_target.ipynb 
- A random cup we found in the office and recorded using our setup, 'X' image projected to it using set_point_cloud_target.ipynb 
- A plate from IKEA, recorded using our setup (it includes the exploration target by itself)
