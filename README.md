# ergodic-control-sandbox

Sandbox code for "Tutorial on Ergodic Control @ ICRA 2024"

This package implements an ergodic controller on point clouds. [[Google colab]](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WFfS4oKQ089wCDgMpZatVTfI6JyIskCY?usp=sharing)

## Table of Contents

Notebooks:
- annotate_target_obstacle.ipynb  
    - Loads a user-defined point cloud, let's the user draw the target using mouse, visualizes it and saves the point cloud to be used with ergodic_control notebook.
- ergodic_control_point_cloud.ipynb
    - A notebook describing the whole method from start to finish with references and equations.

- Google colab version of the ergodic_control_point_cloud.ipynb, you can play with this without installing anything to your computer: 
  - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WFfS4oKQ089wCDgMpZatVTfI6JyIskCY?usp=sharing


Scripts:
- point_cloud_utils.py
    - Point cloud operations such as read/write kNN queries, gradient computation, etc.
- plotting_utils.py
    - A collection of plotting utility functions used by the notebooks.
- virtual_agents.py
    - Classes for the first and second order virtual agents.

Point clouds:
- Stanford Bunny from the original dataset bun270.ply, 'X' image projected to it using set_point_cloud_target.ipynb 
- A random cup we found in the office and recorded using our setup, 'X' image projected to it using set_point_cloud_target.ipynb 
- A plate from IKEA, recorded using our setup (it includes the exploration target by itself)
